## Getting started

### Prerequisites
You need Docker and a text editor, pretty much it.

### Running
1. Clone the repo
1. Run `docker-compose build`
1. Run `docker-compose up` (add the `-d` flag for daemon mode)
1. Nodemon will boot the app and watch for changes
1. Make changes to the app
1. Commit and repeat.

## Teardown
1. Run `docker-compose down`
1. Profit.
